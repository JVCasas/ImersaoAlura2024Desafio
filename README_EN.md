# Drive Manager - File Organizer for Google Drive - Desafio Imersão IA Alura 2024
---
## About
Drive Manager is a testing project whose ultimate objective is to be a program that is capable of organizing different types of files that are on Google Drive, checking their contents, separating them into themed folders provided by the user, identifying repeated files and deleting or grouping them so that the user can make a decision about them. It is a program written in Python and as it is a program created for the purpose of learning, it is written and commented in a Jupyter Notebook file, detailing its operation step by step. I intend to turn it into an executable file when finished. I will be making updates and commenting on the code in Portuguese initially, both because I do not fully master English and for convenience, however I will be making the relevant updates available in English later. If you have detected a bug and know how to fix it or if you want to propose any improvements, I would be grateful if you could teach me what to do.
## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
As it is a testing program made for studies, modifying and deleting files and using the Gemini API to search the contents of each file, <mark>don't use it in places with files with sensitive or important content, I am not responsible for any possible problems caused by using this program.</mark>
## Context
Imersão IA 2024 was an event that took place between the 6th and 10th of May 2024, held by Alura in partnership with Google, where free classes were available on the use of Google AI, Gemini IA, and other various adjacent topics such as Google AI Studio and APIs. From the 9th until the 11th, a challenge was proposed where event participants would have to create a program using the Gemini IA API, where, through a vote among the participants themselves, 30 projects would be selected for a next phase, where the projects would be evaluated by the event staff on topics such as originality and usefulness, the 5 best projects in this 2nd phase would be awarded, the first place winner would receive a 100% scholarship at FIAP, you can find out more about it [here](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/top5-projetos-imersao-ia)
Unfortunately, I didn't get past the first phase, but as I was having fun with the project and wanted to delve deeper into the topics I learned during the event, I continued with the project.
## Development stages
The following steps are just a guide, they can be added, modified or removed as needed.
### 1st Phase - .txt files
- [x] Create a functional program that can separate .txt files (all arranged in a single folder, without subfolders) by subject into dedicated folders.
- [ ] Make the program able to work with files within subfolders.
- [ ] Make the program resolve file conflicts with the same name and contents.
- [ ] Make the program resolve file conflicts of the type name equal content different.
- [ ] Make the program resolve file conflicts of different name content equal.
### 2nd Phase - image files
- [ ] Make the program separate image files by subject or context.
- [ ] Make the program resolve image file conflicts.
### 3rd Phase - mixed files (text x image)
- [ ] Make the program separate pdf, doc, docx and other files, by theme.
- [ ] Make the program resolve mixed file conflicts (text x image)
### 4th Phase - audio files
- [ ] Make the program separate mp3, wav, ogg files and others, by theme.
- [ ] Make the program resolve audio file conflicts.
### 5th Phase - video files
- [ ] Make the program separate mp4, mkv, webm and other files, by theme.
- [ ] Make the program resolve video file conflicts.
